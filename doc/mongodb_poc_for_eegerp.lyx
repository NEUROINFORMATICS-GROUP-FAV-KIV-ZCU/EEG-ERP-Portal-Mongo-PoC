\begin_layout Section
Project Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EEG/ERP Portal (further referenced as the Portal) is a java-based web
 application developed at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
 at the University of West Bohemia.
 It's purpose is to store, manage, process and share neuroscience data.
 These data are often stored with lots of meta-data (environment, device
 settings, subject information).
 Currently the Portal's data layer is built on Oracle RDBMS.
 For the reasons mentioned further in this document, it's been decided to
 explore whether and how NOSQL databases (MongoDB in particular) could be
 used in the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Project Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In comparison to relational databases, the expected benefits from using
 MongoDB are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
higher flexibility - ability to store various (even unexpected) meta-data
 without the need of changes in the application's data model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
faster search by meta-data values - key:value search should provide performance
 boost thanks to removing the need to join tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are also several questions to discuss:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What changes to the application would have to be done to switch the database
 engines?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What disadvantages would the switch bring?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following subset of experiment meta-data has been selected for the PoC:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
start and end time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
research group the experiment belongs to
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
its title and owner's name
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
name of the experiment owner (the responsible person)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
title, description, name of the scenario's owner
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
weather, environment notes, electrode settings, artifact information
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Oracle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A copy of the Portal's database has been extended by additional triggers
 for auto-incrementing primary keys of the tables relevant to the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
MongoDB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sample JSON document has been designed to represent the default data structure.
 The document shall be attached to this paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Test Framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A framework has been developed for easier and repeatable testing.
 It's written in Python which has been chosen for mature drivers for both
 the database engines, good handling of data collections and fast development.
 The framework provides following functionality:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
parameter-based generating of test data into Oracle DB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
export of all the experiments in OracleDB into MongoDB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
running bulks of queries on both the databases
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
measures the execution time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
parameter-based bulk size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
possibility to run bulks in parallel to increase server load
\end_layout

\end_deeper

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three test cases (queries) were used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Search by scenario name (single join in Oracle)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Search by name of a research group's owner (two joins in Oracle)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Search by age of a subject (aggregation function in Oracle, date comparison
 in MongoDB)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each test process consisted of 100 queries in a row.
 In each iteration the tests were run in 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 parallel
 processes.
 Therefore 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 queries had been run in each
 iteration.
 Detailed results can be found in the attached files (results.pdf and results_ind.
pdf).
 Each file contains two tables per test case (one for MongoDB, one for Oracle).
 One row in each table represents one iteration.
 Each column represents number of parallel processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For MongoDB six iterations were run without indexes (file results.pdf), followed
 by six iterations with indexes created (file results_ind.pdf).
 For Oracle, all 12 iterations were run with indexes created for the relevant
 columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tests have provided following output:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MongoDB returns results on average 2-3 times faster than Oracle in most
 cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Indexes in MongoDB didnt seem to have any significant effect on performance.
\begin_inset Newpage clearpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When running queries in parallel MongoDB performs much better for queries
 1.
 and 2.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Oracle kept the same query/s ratio (which resulted in exponential growth
 of test duration, depending on number of threads)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
query/s ratio of MongoDB was increasing significantly up to 8 threads (and
 it kept the ratio for 16 and 32 threads)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
MongoDB had problems with query 3.
 under heavy load (16 and 32 threads)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
this was the only case where Oracle performed better
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
one of the reasons might be that while Oracle can get the age value from
 a date, MongoDB has to compare dates directly
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Stability
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
MongoDB gave stable results for all iterations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Oracle experienced significant performance jumps during iterations, for
 unknown reason (as a result the average query/s ratio contains rather high
 statistical error)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Flexibility
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Flexibility"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to its query system and document nature, MongoDB is suitable for searching
 experiment meta-data.
 However, it doesn't provide an ultimate solution for the Portal as there
 are pieces of information for which relational integrity is required (typically
 subject or owner information).
 MongoDB does support foreign keys, yet their usage would result in multiple
 queries (as it doesn't support joins).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore several options occur, each with own difficulties to overcome:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Keep current solution
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
easy way to maintain data integrity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
not a flexible data model
\begin_inset Newpage clearpage
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Transfer all data to MongoDB 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
flexible data model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
many problems
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
either lots of duplicate data or references
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
probably some application changes required
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
fast read queries
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
possible need for multiple queries (in case of references usage) to retrieve
 all the data
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Parallel use of both database engines
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
in one application - cooperation on the Portal's data layer
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
keep data which require relational integrity in Oracle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
keep experiment-specific meta-data in MongoDB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
most difficult to implement
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
probably most complicated changes to the application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
how to query effitiently?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
how to handle transactions?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
separate data warehouse
\end_layout

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
implement separate experiment data storage on top of MongoDB and access
 it from the Portal via public API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
would require changes in the Portal's application structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
similar integrity issues as with (a)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The option 2 seems to be the least suitable for the project such as the
 Portal.
 Even though the NOSQL database provides good facility for storing neuroscience
 experiments, it is not a good choice for current version of the Portal's
 domain.
 Any attempt to use solely MongoDB as the Portal's data storage would probably
 result in large changes in the application and its domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The option 1 is the safest one, while option 3 is worth further investigation
 as it might result in a solution which would be able to combine strong
 sides of the both concepts.
 The recommended approach would be creating a layer between the application
 and persistence - JPA (Hibernate) and MongoDB API.
 At the moment it is obvious that it's not going to be a trivial task.

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the experiment it has been confirmed that MongoDB is an eligible
 solution for storing neuroscience data, as claimed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StorageBit"

\end_inset

.
 Thanks to its flexible nature, the database doesn't limit researches by
 number or structure of stored meta-data.
 In addition MongoDB provides fast querying and insertion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However transition from the current solution to the one proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StorageBit"

\end_inset

 is not going to be a simple one, because the proposal doesn't consider
 an application of the Portal's size and complexity.
 It seems unlikely that the Portal can work without maintaining referential
 integrity for some pieces of information.
 Therefore one of the options proposed in this paper (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Flexibility"

\end_inset

) should be considered.
